# Network-Simulation
- This project is developed using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
- This is a networking project. 
- The project involves designing a network topology and configure the network devices to test the network traffic in a virtual environment. 
- The network design of the project addresses the issues in the current network infrastructure of the college.
- Using the simulation feature of Cisco Packet Tracer tool we can observe and test the packet flow in the network under different scenarios.
